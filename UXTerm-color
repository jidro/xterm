! Disclaimer: there are no standard colors used in terminal emulation.
!
! The choice for color4 and color12 is a tradeoff between contrast, depending
! on whether they are used for text or backgrounds.  Note that either color4 or
! color12 would be used for text, while only color4 would be used for a
! background.  These are treated specially, since the luminosity of blue is
! only about half that of red/green, and is typically not accounted for in the
! RGB scheme.
!
! Blue text on a black background should be readable.
! Blue backgrounds should not be "too" bright.
!
! Originally color4/color12 were set to the names blue3/blue
!UXTerm*VT100*color4: blue3
!UXTerm*VT100*color12: blue
!
! They are from rgb.txt respectively:
!  0   0 205		blue3
!  0   0 255		blue
! However, blue3 is not readable on a black background.
!
! Another choice was from the Debian settings:
!UXTerm*VT100*color4: DodgerBlue1
!UXTerm*VT100*color12: SteelBlue1
!
! From rgb.txt:
! 30 144 255		DodgerBlue1
! 99 184 255		SteelBlue1
!
! Some users object to this choice because the background (color4) is brighter
! than they are accustomed.  Others point out that the different weights for
! the red/green components make it appear to be not really blue.  Finally, it
! provides poor contrast against color13 and color14.
!
! The current choice uses equal weights for red/green (effectively adding a
! gray to the result).  It is brighter than the original choice, and provides
! more contrast between color12 and color13, color14 than SteelBlue1 did.
! Contrast of color4 against black is slightly improved over the original.
!
! Some refinement is certainly possible (you are welcome to try) -TD
